# DataInterpolations.jl

This library is meant for interpolating one dimensional data by methods which
both hit every point exactly or smooth the data into an approximate fitting
curve. The library contains the following interpolation methods:

-  Linear Interpolation
-  Quadratic Interpolation
-  Lagrange Interpolation
-  Zero Spline
-  Quadratic Spline
-  Cubic Spline
-  BSpline Global Curve Interpolation
-  BSpline Global Curve Approximation
-  Curve fitting
